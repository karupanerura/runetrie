// Package runetrie provides an efficient, generic implementation of the trie (prefix tree) data structure
// for string matching operations.
//
// A trie, also known as a prefix tree, is a data structure that allows for efficient string lookups,
// prefix matching, and related operations with better performance characteristics than
// linear string comparisons in many scenarios.
//
// The implementation uses generic types allowing it to work with any string-like type.
//
// The package is designed for performance, with efficient lookups compared to linear string
// comparison approaches, especially when handling a large set of strings.
